            Zenos.AI consists of Human Movement Scientists and AI researchers that develop computational physiological models since 2025. 
            Backed by the latest research, insights and data we aim to push the boundaries of physiological modelling.

            Scientific Pioneering
        </h2>
        <p class="pjust">
            The name Zenos.AI refers to the Greek philosopher Zeno. 
            Some 2000 years ago Zeno made up a story of a tortoise beating Achilles, the fittest Greek on earth.
            Ofcourse, we are facing a misconception here. 
            But from the perspective of scientific pioneering Zeno's reasoning was not so absurd. 
            We as humans set goals, improve and along the way set more ambitious goals by shifting the 'tortoise' forward. 
            Thereby, creating a never ending race, a race where Achilles can truely never win. 
            The end of the race is only limited by our imagination.

            Aiming for the Unimaginable
        </h2>
        <p class="pjust">
           Zenos.AI aims for the unimaginable, that temporarily stationarity. 
            Our goal is a mathematical model that fully integrates all of human physiology, achieved through a 
            combination of domain knowledge, computational models, and advanced machine learning techniques. 
            Just because we, at Zenos.AI, believe that the highest reward is there where the unimaginable meets reality.
