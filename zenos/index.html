            Human Movement Scientists and AI researchers developing computational physiological models since 2025. 
            Backed by the latest research, insights and data we aim to push the boundaries of physiological modelling. 
            Building from scratch and starting over and over again, because scientific pioneering is not for the weak.

            Scientific Pioneering ~ A Never ending race
        </h2>
        <p class="pjust">
            A tortoise beating Achilles, the fittest Greek on earth, sounds like a fairy tale. 
            But, more then 2000 years ago the Greek philosopher Zeno was not so sure.
            Ofcourse, we are facing a misconception here. 
            But from the perspective of scientific pioneering Zeno's reasoning was not so absurd. 
            We as humans set goals, improve and along the way set more ambitious goals by shifting the 'tortoise' forward. 
            Thereby, creating a never ending race, a race where Achilles can truely never win.

            The Finish Line
        </h2>
        <p class="pjust">
           The end of the race is only limited by our imagination; 
            the finish line is there where goals are so ambitious that no one knows what is ahead. 
            A temporarily stationarity, or in other words a point that might turn out to be the end of our 
            journey, or only the beginning of a new, historic, adventure!

           Zenos.AI aims for the unimaginable, that temporarily stationarity. 
            Our goal is a mathematical model that fully integrates all of human physiology, achieved through a 
            combination of domain knowledge, computational models, and advanced machine learning techniques. 
            Just because we, at Zenos.AI, believe that the highest reward is there where the unimaginable meets reality.
